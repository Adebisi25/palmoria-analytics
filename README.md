## 📊 Key Insights

- ⚖️ **Gender Imbalance**: Certain departments are heavily male-dominated. “Undisclosed” gender values also highlight missing data.
- 💰 **Pay Gaps**: Gender-based pay gaps exist in several departments. Many employees fall below the mandated $90,000 minimum salary.
- 📉 **Performance Evaluation**: Ratings are generally average, with minor differences between genders but inconsistent bonus allocation.
- 🎁 **Bonus Distribution**: Bonus payouts vary by department, with some rated employees receiving unequal bonuses for similar performance levels.
- 🌍 **Location-Specific Trends**: Some locations have a higher concentration of underpaid or low-rated staff, requiring targeted intervention.
